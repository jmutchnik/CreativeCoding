EDPX 3701: Creative Coding

Dan Wilcox



Exercise 1:

Draw a face in openFrameworks using only the 2d drawing commands, color settings, and draw settings. Use variables and at least 10 different graphical elements.


I chose to create a robot face using different colors and shapes.



Exercise 2:

Create a project that contains: mouse interaction, key interaction, & animation.


- Mouse position is mapped to the radius of the circle

- Circle is animated using sin & cosine

- Key press leaves a trail, and produces random rectangles.


Exercise 3:

Make a simple project using 2 addons, 1 of which you should download from GitHub. Combine the addons so that both are used in conjunction in some way.



Addons Included: ofxGui, ofxLiquidFun


ofxLiquidFun:
- If you drag the mouse, particles are created
- Press "c" for circles to appear
-Press "b" for boxes to appear"

ofxGui:

-creates GUI panel
- sliders that control the size & color of the circles and boxes
